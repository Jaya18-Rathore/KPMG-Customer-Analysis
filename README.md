# KPMG-Customer-Analysis
I have finished the KPMG Consumer Analysis Task. I've finished all three jobs, which include examining company data sets and enhancing their data quality. Finally, using an analysis of customer behaviour trends and patterns, 1000 specific customers were targeted. Afterward, a dashboard built with Excel was used to represent all of these insights.
